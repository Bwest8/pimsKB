# Students to be Reported in PIMS

All Pre-K through grade 12 and Adult Affidavit Program (AAP) students enrolled in a public school and students enrolled in an Approved Private School (APS) or Private Residential Rehabilitation Institution (PRRI) in Pennsylvania shall be reported in PIMS. Student data will be submitted through templates. See the template section of this document for more information.

It is important to note that Keystone State ChalleNGe Academy membership and attendance should be excluded from the child accounting data in the Student Calendar Fact template.

:::note

## Half-Day vs. Full-Day Kindergarten Students

**Half-Day:** Report kindergarten students who participate in a half-day program that provides a minimum of 2.5 instructional hours (but less than 5 instructional hours) every day. Also report as half-day any student who participates in an alternate day kindergarten program. An alternate kindergarten program provides an average of 12.5 hours per week or minimum 450 instructional hours per year.

**Full-Day:** Report kindergarten students who participate in a full-day program that provides a minimum of 5 instructional hours every day.

## Reporting Pre-Kindergarten (Pre-K) Students

Record all students enrolled in the LEA’s Pre-K program, where most children will be three or four years of age. There may be exceptions in which children either are younger or older than this. Include all these students, regardless of funding source, including any students who are Head Start or PA Pre-K Counts students as described below.
LEAs should report any Pre-K students they educate with Head Start or PA Pre-K Counts funding. If an LEA provides Head Start or PA Pre-K Counts funds to another entity, the LEA providing the funds is only responsible to report the students it directly educates.
If there exists a cooperative relationship between the LEA and a Head Start or PA Pre-K Counts program, but the service delivery and cost are not provided by the LEA, the LEA should not report these students, even if they are located in the LEA’s facilities. In certain cases, an LEA allows a Head Start or PA Pre-K Counts program to use some of its unused classroom space, but that does not make it the LEA’s program. In true partnerships, there is a more involved relationship where there is joint responsibility for the program and/or cost.
PA Pre-K Counts membership and attendance should be excluded from the child accounting data in the Student Calendar Fact Template.

## Reporting Kindergarten Students (K4)

When the LEA operates a two-year kindergarten program (i.e., K4 and K5), record as K4 all students who meet the entry age established by the local school board for four-year-old kindergarten students according to State Board of Education Regulations (Chapter 11 (Student Attendance) of Title 22 of the Pennsylvania Code; section 11.14 Admission to Kindergarten when provided).

K4 includes Head Start students if they are part of an authorized program of the LEA. That is, if the LEA is in a partnership with a Head Start grantee in which the delivery and/or cost of providing the K4 program is shared in some way between the Head Start grantee and the LEA, count these students in the enrollment report. Or, if the LEA is the Head Start grantee or delegate agency, only count students in classrooms operated by the LEA on the October 1 report. **If there exists a cooperative relationship between the LEA and the Head Start program, but the two delivery systems and funding remain completely separate, do not count these students**, even if they are located in LEA facilities. In certain cases, an LEA allows the Head Start agency to use some of its unused classroom space, but that does not make it the LEAs program. In true partnerships, there is a more involved relationship where there is joint responsibility for the program and/or funding.

## Reporting Kindergarten Students (K5)

Record the second year of a two-year kindergarten program or single year of a traditional one-year kindergarten program (which most LEAs offer). Students generally are five years old at the beginning of the school year.
Reporting School-Age Early Intervention Students
School-age early intervention students in LEA-based half-time or full-time programs should be reported as kindergarten students (K4 or K5). The determination of whether data is to be reported for a child is based on the kindergarten entry age for the LEA where the child would have attended school if the child were not in the early intervention program.
The Mutually Agreed Upon Written Arrangement (MAWA) holder, an intermediate unit, or school district providing education to school-age early intervention students will upload child accounting instructional time and membership data in the School Calendar and Student Calendar Fact files.

## Reporting Exceptional Students
Pertinent to students in full-time programs for the physically or emotionally disabled, mentally gifted, intellectually disabled, and other exceptionalities, report the student’s actual grade level as indicated in their IEP.

## Entering the Administrative Unit Number (AUN) in the District Fields on the PIMS Student Templates
For clarification of the Residency Status and District Codes, refer to Appendix N in the PIMS User Manual, Volume 2.  

:::note 
Codes apply to all grade levels except for AAP students.

Reporting AAP students in the School Enrollment Template is not required or needed. LEAs may report 999999999 in the District of Residence AUN and should report the AUN of the school district where the CTE-educating LEA is located in the Funding District AUN for AAP students.
