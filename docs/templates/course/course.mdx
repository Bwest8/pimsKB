## Template Description

This template is used to collect the attributes of each course at each school. Use the Course Instructor Template to associate the Teacher of Record with each course section. Use the Student Course Enrollment Template to associate courses with the students enrolled in each section. This table maps the local course to the standardized state codes. The Course Template should include all courses with students enrolled during the current school year.

:::note
- Accurate reporting of courses in assessed grades/subjects is especially important. PDE will use course data to inform attribution decisions related to accountability.
- Courses may have multiple sections. Each course should have a single Course Code Long. Do not give separate sections of the same course different local course codes.
