# What is PIMS?

The Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS) is a free Statewide Longitudinal Data System (SLDS). PIMS allows the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) to collect, store, and analyze individual data for publicly educated, pre-K through 12th grade students across the commonwealth to help districts, schools, and teachers make informed, data-driven decisions that improve student learning.
