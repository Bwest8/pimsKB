**Target Table(s): `SCHOOL_ENROLL`**

## Template Description

This template contains the student enrollment and withdrawal transactions at each school within each LEA. This template will be used to track student mobility. Submit all mobility transactions for all students throughout the entire year, not just students active at the end of the year, and not just the last transaction for a student. At least one record should exist in this template for every student enrolled in an LEA at any time during the school year.

For each reporting date, submit all enrollment entry and exit transactions that occurred since the prior reporting date. For example, for the December Collection Period, submit all transactions dated since the October Collection period. In the event that an enrollment transaction wasn’t entered in the previous reporting period, it is still acceptable to enter the enrollment transaction as long as it occurred within the current school year.

School Enrollment Records are required for all students reported by CTCs with the exceptions of the following:

-   Student Template Field 65 Grad Status Code of S or J
-   Adult Affidavit Program (AAP) students

All other LEA types must report School Enrollment Records for all students with the following exceptions:

-   Student Template Field 65 Grad Status Code of S or J
-   Student Template Field 167 Special Ed Referral = Y
-   Student Template Field 217 AUN of Enrollment is not equal to Field 1 Submitting AUN (for non-CTCs only) - Does not apply when field 217 is an APS/LPAS

:::note

Entry and withdrawal codes help determine the calculation of Full Academic Year (FAY), which is defined as a student being continuously enrolled on or before October 1, 2021, until the last day of the testing window for each subject-specific PSSA and Keystone Exam dates.
