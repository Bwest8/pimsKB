## Template Description

The District Fact Template for ELs is used to submit the following data sets:

### Title III Nonpublic Student Counts

LEAs are required to submit a District Fact Template using the template specification for EL data found under the District Domain in PIMS User Manual volume 1. Instructions on how to report data where category 3 is NONPUB are found in [Appendix AF](docs/appendix/appendix-AF.mdx). The only data elements reported for this PIMS submission within Appendix AF are those where category 3 is `NONPUB`. Nonpublic Student Counts are reported by LEAs during PIMS Collection 1 using the District Fact Template, whether the LEA has a nonpublic student count or not.

**Purpose**   
LEAs must consult with nonpublic entities within the geographic boundaries served by the LEA to confirm the count of nonpublic ELs, nonpublic immigrant children and youth and nonpublic schools. The count reported is used to determine Title III allocations for nonpublic ELs and nonpublic immigrant children and youth.

:::note
The count reported is for **nonpublic** ELs and nonpublic immigrant children and youth. The LEAs EL and immigrant children and youth do not count. If the LEA does not have any nonpublic students to report, zero values need to be reported.

### Title III Professional Development Activities Survey

LEAs can submit results via an Excel file developed specifically for this data set, which automatically creates the District Fact Template for ELs that LEAS can then submit to PIMS. This spreadsheet is located on the [PDE website](http://www.education.pa.gov) under Data & Reporting/PIMS/Excel Reporting Tools [Title III Professional Development Activities Survey](https://www.education.pa.gov/Documents/Teachers-Administrators/PIMS/Excel%20Reporting%20Tools/Title%20III%20Professional%20Development%20Activities%20Survey.xls). Instructions on how to complete the survey are found in [Appendix AI](docs/appendix/appendix-AI.mdx) of the PIMS User Manual volume 2. LEAs can also choose to submit results via the District Fact Template for EL Data found under the District Domain District Fact Template for ELs in PIMS User Manual volume 1. The Title III Professional Development Activities Survey must be submitted by all Title III sub-grantees who accepted Title III funds. The Title III Professional Development Activities Survey is collected during PIMS Collection 1. The data reported in this survey during the PIMS Collection is for the previous SY.

**Purpose**  
Title III requires sub-grantees to conduct professional development for classroom teachers (content and ESL), principals, administrators, and other school and community personnel related to instruction, assessment, standards, curriculum, and subject matter. In this survey, sub-grantees report the type of professional development activities conducted and report who participated in the professional development.

:::note
If the sub-grantee does not have a count, zero values need to be reported.

### LIEP (Language Instruction Education Program) Survey

LEAs can submit results via an Excel file developed specifically for this data set, which automatically creates the District Fact Template for ELs that LEAs can then submit to PIMS. This form is located on the [PDE website](http://www.education.pa.gov/) under Data & Reporting/PIMS/ Excel Reporting Tools [LIEP Survey](https://www.education.pa.gov/Documents/Teachers-Administrators/PIMS/Excel%20Reporting%20Tools/LIEP%20Survey.xlsx). Instructions on how to complete the survey are found in [Appendix AF](docs/appendix/appendix-AF.mdx). LEAs can also choose to submit results via the District Fact Template using the template specification for EL data found under the District Domain in PIMS User Manual volume 1. The LIEP Survey is required to be submitted by School Districts, Comprehensive Career and Technical Centers, and Charter Schools during PIMS Collection 4.

**Purpose**  
4.26 - Chapter 4.26 of Title 22 of the Pennsylvania Code references the required components of the LIEP. Every LEA is required to provide a program for each student whose dominant language is not English for the purpose of facilitating the student's achievement of English Proficiency and the academic standards. To do so, every LEA must have a written Board approved LIEP which describes in detail how the LEA will ensure that Els increase English proficiency, attain English proficiency and meet academic standards while they're progressing toward attainment of English proficiency. For LEAs who do not have Els at this time, the LEA will need to refer to the LEAs Board approved LIEP policy to complete these questions.

Valid values:  
Yes = LEA maintains documentation of the requirement.  
No = LEA does not include requirement in its Board approved LIEP.

#### Assessments

LEAs must indicate the assessments administered to Els upon entry, ongoing, and at the time of exit. More than one assessment may be chosen for each category listed. K-WAPT (Kindergarten) or Kindergarten MODEL must be used for placement of Kindergarteners and WIDA Screener (Grades 1-12) or the WIDA MODEL grades 1 to 12 are required for placement of Els in grades 1 to 12, so one or both of the assessments for each grade band must be included as assessments used upon entry. ACCESS for ELLs is required for ongoing and exit, so it must be included as an assessment used for ongoing and exit. If the LEA uses an assessment that does not appear within Category 3, email the name of the assessment the LEA is using to [RA-EDELD@pa.gov](mailto:RA-EDELD@pa.gov).

#### Bilingual Program Model

If the LEA implements a Bilingual Program model(s) (Mixed Bilingual, EL Bilingual, EL Specific, Transitional Instruction, or Mixed Classes with Native Language Support) it must provide the code of the language other than English used for instruction. Reference Appendix J, PIMS User Manual Volume 2, for the language codes.

#### Teacher Counts

LEAs must provide an estimate of the total number of additional certified or licensed teachers that will be needed for LIEPs over the next five years. This estimate should be the total additional teachers needed over the next 5 years, not the number needed for each year.

To determine what teachers to count as working within your LIEP you need to refer to the type(s) of instruction you indicated in Field 45 of the Student Template. For example, if your LEA is implementing an EL Specific English-only Instruction Program, your teacher counts are based on those teachers. If your LEA is implementing an EL Bilingual Program, an EL Specific English-only Instruction Program, and a Mixed Classes with English-only Support program, your teacher counts are based on those teachers. If you are implementing more than one LIEP, your teacher counts are based on the total number of teachers for all LIEP offered at your LEA.

:::note
If the LEA does not have a count, zero values need to be reported.
:::

#### Budget

LEAs must provide the dollar amount budgeted for LIEP.

### Title III Professional Development Activities Survey and LIEP Survey Reporting Tools
