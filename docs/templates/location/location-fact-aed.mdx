## Template Description

The Location Fact Template for AED Excel reporting tool is emailed to LEAs from PDE. The reporting tool is used to submit the results of AED Report Form. Information is captured in an Excel file, automatically creating the Location Fact Template to be submitted to PIMS.

The PDE- provided reporting tool consists of 21 rows for each location within the LEA, and for the non-school School Number 9999. School Number 9999 is to be used for AEDs that are normally kept in a location not having a School Number, such as an athletic building, in the school resource officer’s vehicle, on a school bus, etc.

The first row for each location allows for reporting that a location has no AEDs. The remaining rows allow for reporting data for up to 20 AEDs. If your LEA must report more than 20 AEDs at a single location, contact the PDE Data Collection Team at [ra-DDQDataCollection@pa.gov](mailto:ra-DDQDataCollection@pa.gov) for assistance.

The AED numbers in the Category 02 column of the Location Fact Template are to assign a unique or ‘key’ value to each record. You need not associate this with any identifying numbers already on the AED.

Although every row of the reporting tool is populated with some data, and all rows may be uploaded, PDE will only use the rows in which the indicator (Field 18) is Y. A Y in this field indicates that you are reporting that the location has no AEDs (if the value in Category 02 is NONE) or you are reporting data for an AED (if the value in Category 02 is AED01 through AED20).

To report a location that has one or more AEDs, find the row for that location having AED01 in the Category 02 field (Field 5):

1.  Enter the general condition of the AED in the condition field (Field 6). Valid values are NEW, GOOD, FAIR, or POOR (uppercase only).
2.  Enter Y (uppercase only) in the indicator field (Field 18).
3.  Enter the school year in which the AED was first put into service in the Service Date field (Field 20). Use the June 30 date ending the school year. The current school year is reported as 2022-06-30. Date must be in ISO format.
4.  Enter the actual date on which the current inspection for the AED expires in the Date Inspection Expires field (Field 21). If components have separate inspection expiration dates, report the earliest date. Date must be in ISO format.
5.  Enter a brief description of the location of the AED in the Placement field (Field 22).
6.  Repeat as needed for each AED at each location.

Save and Upload the File:

1.  Click on Save As and name the file correctly (SUBMITTINGAUN_LOCATION_FACT_DATE&TIME).

    Example file name: `123456789_LOCATION_FACT_201506110800`.

2.  Save file type as a .csv file
3.  Upload the .csv file into PIMS as a Location Fact Template via the C6 Safe Schools - AED data set
