## Template Description

The Location Fact Template for Fire and Security Drills Excel reporting tool is emailed to LEAs from PDE. The reporting tool is used to submit the results of the Fire and Security Drills Report Form. Information is captured in an Excel file, automatically creating the Location Fact Template to be submitted to PIMS.

The PDE-provided reporting tool consists of thirteen rows for each location within the LEA, one row to be used to identify the first day of school for each location and one row for each month of the year. Every location should report every month whether or not a drill was held. Do not delete or add rows to the reporting tool.

The first row for each LEA location is for reporting the first day of school (Category 03 = FIRSTDAY). Enter Y in the Indicator field, and the date of the first day of school in the Date field.

During the months that there is a fire or security drill held at the LEA a “Y” will be entered in Field 18 (Indicator) and the date the drill took place will be entered in Field 20 (Start Date). On months where no fire or security drill took place an “N” will be entered in Field 18 (Indicator) and a comment as to why no drill took place will be entered in Field 22 (Comment).

Report no more than one drill in a month. If drills in addition to the required drill are conducted, report only the required drill.

Where a single School Number represents more than one physical location (i.e., 0000 for an Intermediate Unit with multiple buildings) and the drills for a month are conducted on different days, report the date on which the final drill was conducted, bringing the location into compliance. For example, there are three physical buildings reported under a single School Number. Buildings 1 and 2 conducted a drill on May 4; building 3 conducted a drill on May 7. Report the drill using the May 7 date.

Section 1517 of the Public School Code requires that a security drill be conducted within 90 days of the commencement of the school year in place of a fire drill and allows two additional security drills to be conducted in place of two fire drills after 90 days from the commencement of the school year (this means ninety (90) calendar days). When a security drill is reported in place of a fire drill, substitute “SECURITY”” for “FIRE” in Field 5, Category 2. Section 1517 establishes specific requirements for the conduct of security drills.

In Category 4 select one of three indicators (01-No Students at that location, 02-School not in session during this month, 03-Other) that explains why no drill was held that month. If 03 is entered in Category 4, briefly describe the other reason in the Field 22 (Comment).

Save and Upload the File:

1.  Click on Save As and name the file correctly (SUBMITTINGAUN_LOCATION_FACT_DATE&TIME).

    Example file name: 123456789_LOCATION_FACT_201506110800.

2.  Save file type as a .csv file.
3.  Upload the .csv file into PIMS as a Location Fact Template via the C6 Safe Schools - Fire/Sec data set.
