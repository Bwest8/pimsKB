# Discipline Domain

LEAs are required to submit the following templates within the Discipline Domain:

- Incident
- Person
- Incident Offender
- Incident Offender Infraction
- Incident Offender Infraction Weapon
- Incident Offender Disciplinary Action
- Incident Offender Parent Involvement
- Incident Victim

**This domain applies to the following organizational types:**

- School Districts
- Intermediate Units
- Career and Technical Centers
- Charter Schools

This domain is used to track School Safety incidents involving all students (including special education students). An incident is defined as a specific act or offense involving one or more victims or offenders. A reportable incident includes one or more acts of misconduct, involving one or more offenders violating criteria defined under Pennsylvania's [Act 26 of 1995](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=1995&sessInd=0&act=26). These include, but are not limited to, any behavior that violates a school's educational mission or climate of respect or jeopardizes the intent of the school to be free of aggression against persons or property, drugs, weapons, disruptions, and disorder. Examples are incidents involving acts of violence, possession of a weapon, or the possession, use or sale of a controlled substance, alcohol, or tobacco by any person on school property, at school-sponsored events, and on school transportation to and from school.

See [Appendix Z](docs/appendix/appendix-Z.mdx) for a list of the infraction codes that are to be reported in these Discipline Domain templates.

If a school has no reportable School Safety incidents for the entire school year a record indicating this must be entered in the Location Fact Template, refer to that section.

:::note
An incident is to be reported by the entity that provides the discipline. For example, if a reportable incident occurs in the confines of a class offered by an IU the IU should report the incident if the IU disciplines the student. If the student is referred to the district of residence or charter school (sending LEA) for discipline, the district of residence or charter should report the incident.
