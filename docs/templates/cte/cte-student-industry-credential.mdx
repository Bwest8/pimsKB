## Template Description

The CTE Student Industry Credential Template serves to record industry certifications earned by **students during the reporting year as a direct result of the student's enrollment within a PDE-approved reimbursable secondary CTE program or registered adult affidavit program reported within the CTE Student Fact Template.**

**This data also informs the Industry-Based Learning indicator in the Future Ready PA Index.**

Additional information can be found in the [Industry-Based Learning Indicator guidelines document](https://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/Career%20and%20Technical%20Education/Resources/Teacher%20Resources/IndustryRecognized/Pages/default.aspx).

:::warning[IMPORTANT NOTE:]
Only LEAs with PDE-approved reimbursable secondary CTE programs or registered adult affidavit CTE programs in the reporting year submit this template to record appropriate industry certifications earned by students reported within the CTE Student Fact Template. 

LEAs need not submit this template if none of their CTE students reported within the CTE Student Fact Template earned certifications.
