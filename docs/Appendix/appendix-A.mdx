# Appendix A – Course Codes

Course Codes are found in the Course Codes – App A spreadsheet on the Pennsylvania Department of Education \> Data and Reporting \> PIMS \> [Manuals and Calendar](https://www.education.pa.gov/DataAndReporting/PIMS/ManualsCalendar/Pages/default.aspx) page.

Each course code submitted to PIMS must be mapped to a standardized state course code; the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) lists standardized courses for use in federal reporting for Act 13 Building Score calculation, the Future Ready PA Index, and ESSA.

The standardized course list is based on the 5-digit course codes in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) School Codes for the Exchange of Data (SCED) classification system for courses in the United States. Information, including course descriptions, is available in the *School Course Classification System: School Codes for Exchange of Data (SCED),* found on the [NCES website](http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2007341) (nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp).

Beginning in the 2019-20 school year, LEAs are required to submit all course subject areas. The new subject area data is required to support new federal reporting requirements that are not limited to the Core Content subjects. Only Core Content subject area courses will still be used to calculate the Building Score calculation used in educator evaluation, as prescribed under [ACT 13 of 2020](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=2020&sessInd=0&act=13) (Note: School-level PVAAS is also included in the Act 13 Building Score calculation but is not indicated in this appendix).

Applications might include wages, hourly rates, payroll deductions, sales, receipts, accounts payable and receivable, financial reports, discounts, and interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |        |                 |        |                  |

These courses emphasize performance and typically require auditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |        |        |                 |        |                  |

AP Music Theory develops students’ understanding of musical structure and compositional procedures. Usually intended for students who already possess performance-level skills, AP Music Theory courses extend and build upon students’ knowledge of intervals, scales, chords, metric/rhythmic patterns, and the ways they interact in a composition. Musical notation, analysis, composition, and aural skills are important components of the course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Y      |        |                 |        | Y                |
