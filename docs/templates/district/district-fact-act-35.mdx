## Template Description

The District Fact Template is used to submit counts of the total budgeted complement of professional staff positions and the number of those budgeted professional staff positions that are vacant as of the date of final budget adoption by the LEA's governing Board.

Professional staff positions are those that are listed in PIMS Manual, Volume 2, Appendix B. For this collection, a vacant position shall be defined as an unoccupied position that has been board approved and posted to allow the LEA to proceed through the hiring process.

:::note
Any posted position that is currently filled by an individual with a Type 01 Emergency Permit is not considered unoccupied and should not be counted as a vacancy.
:::

**This report is required for all LEAs that report Staff data.**
