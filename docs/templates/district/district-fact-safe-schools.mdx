## Template Description

This template is used to report the total number of contracted, rotating school security personnel and the number of contracted, rotating school security personnel with specific trainings or authorizations/qualifications (See Appendix AB). This template should only include those school security personnel that are not reported in the Staff collection templates. It is also used to report the scope (locations served) of security services and if an LEA has no school security personnel.

:::warning[Important Note:]
If an LEA has no school security personnel, there should be a single District fact record where Category 2 = `ZERO` and Count = `0`. 

Records should not be submitted for both Category 2 = `ZERO` and Category 2 = `TOTAL`.
