## Template Description

This template is meant to reflect the current professional employee situation – there is only one LEA record for each professional employee, even if the employee has worked in more than one location within the LEA for a given collection period.

School security personnel, including directly employed or contracted school police officers, school resource officers, and school security officers, are collected in this template. These staff members are to be reported during Collection Window 6 for the Safe Schools data set, not during the October Staff Submission. During this submission only the fields listed below are required. All school security personnel for the entire school year should be reported during this window, even if the individual is no longer working in this capacity at the end of the school year. 

:::note
Professional staff should not be submitted during the summer security staff submission. School security personnel that are reported in this template should not be included in the District Fact Template for Safe Schools.
:::

Staff that were reported as Active in the previous year and have terminated for any reason since October of the prior year should be reported in C1 Staff with Staff and Staff Snapshot including all termination data.

Staff that leave the LEA for any reason after the C1 Staff Collection should be terminated in C6 Staff updates with Staff template having all termination fields completed.

Fields required for the Safe Schools data set during Collection Window 6:

- Field 1 – SUBMITTING AUN
- Field 2 – PPID  
- Field 14 – SCHOOL NUMBER
- Field 48 - STAFF QUALIFICATION STATUS CODE
- Field 65 - FIRST NAME
- Field 66 - LAST NAME 
- Field 95 - AUTHORIZED TO CARRY WEAPON INDICATOR

:::note
If an LEA has no directly employed or contracted school security personnel, a record indicating this must be entered in the District Fact Template, refer to this section.
