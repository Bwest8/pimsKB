## Template Description
This template connects an incident and the offender to an infraction. If multiple infractions apply to the incident/offender submit multiple records; use one record per infraction.

:::note
All discipline incidents resulting in disciplinary action codes `S3` - `S9` must be submitted in the Discipline Domain PIMS submission, **regardless** of the special education status of the student. If an infraction resulting in a suspension or expulsion does not align to one of the 46 numeric safe schools' infraction codes (ending with infraction code `54`), it shall be aligned to either an A - Academic Code of Conduct or a C - Student Code of Conduct discipline infraction type.
