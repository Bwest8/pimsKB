## Template Description

This template identifies whether a student has met the applicable standards for grade 3 reading and grade 7 math where the LEA has chosen to exercise the local assessment option in lieu of the standard PSSA for either or both of the grade 3 reading and grade 7 math indicators of success.

LEAs have the option to report data from locally identified assessment systems for the Grade 3 Reading/Grade 7 Mathematics Early Indicators of Success indicator on the Future Ready PA Index. In identifying an assessment system for this measure, LEAs must take basic steps to evaluate the quality and sufficiency of evidence to support the use of the assessment and interpretation of its results. In addition, to ensure comparability and fairness, all students in the grades 3 and 7 cohorts across the LEA must participate in the same assessment. For more information on these standards and assurances, please refer to the following document: [Guidance for Evaluating Locally Selected Measures for Use in the Future Ready PA Index for Grade 3 Reading and Grade 7 Mathematics](http://www.education.pa.gov/Documents/About%20PDE/FutureReadyPA/Future%20Ready%20PA%20Index%20Gr%203%20Reading%20Gr%207%20Math.pdf). The assessment must provide for accessibility features or accommodations that allow it to be used by a minimum of 95% of the students in each school who are enrolled for a full academic year. Schools that do not attain a 95% participation rate on the locally selected assessment will have their data reverted to PSSA assessment data. Additionally, LEAs who chose not to use locally identified assessments will have their data default to their corresponding PSSA assessments for reporting to the Future Ready PA Index.
