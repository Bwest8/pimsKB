# PIMS Knowledge Base (PIMS KB)

Welcome to the Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS) Knowledge Base, also known as PIMS KB! This documentation has been converted from PDF to a web site for improved accessibility and navigation.

## Introduction

The Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS) is a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) and local education agencies (LEAs) across the commonwealth. PIMS is a statewide, longitudinal data system (SLDS) that efficiently and accurately manages, analyzes, disaggregates, and uses individual data for each student served by Pennsylvania's pre-K through grade 12 public education system.

## Key Purposes of PIMS

PIMS serves several important purposes, including:

- Meeting current state and federal reporting requirements
- Improving education decision-making through the use of high-quality data and decision support tools
- Providing longitudinal tracking of education progress over time and across LEAs
- Reporting timely and accurate education data through standardized and ad hoc reporting capabilities
