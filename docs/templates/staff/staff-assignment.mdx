## Template Description

This template will be used to track point-in-time information on staff assignments. The Staff Assignment Template must be submitted in a point-in-time fashion. Include one record per staff assignment in this template. There is no limit to the number of staff assignments that can be included here. Include all assignments for each staff member. Assignments should exist for all staff included on the Staff Snapshot Template. Do not include short term substitutes in the Staff Assignment Template. **Include long-term substitutes ONLY where filling a vacancy**.

:::note
The percent of time is a cumulative total for the entire school year. **The sum of percent time should equal 100 for full-time staff**.
:::

This template also is used to collect data on the connection between directly employed or contracted school security personnel (including school police officers, school resource officers, and school security guards) and the schools they are responsible for patrolling. These individuals need to be submitted within this template only during the Safe Schools collection in June. All security staff members for the entire year should be reported, even if the individual is no longer working in this capacity at the end of the school year. School security personnel that are reported in this template should not be included in the District Fact Template for Safe Schools. There is a single assignment code for school security staff `9998`.
