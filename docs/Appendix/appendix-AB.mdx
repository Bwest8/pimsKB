# Appendix AB – Categories to Use in the District  Fact Template for Safe Schools

The table below details the values to use in the CATEGORY 1 and CATEGORY 2 fields as well as the COUNT field when reporting zero directly employed or contracted security staff. Alternately, if an LEA contracts with a security company that rotates staff, the values to use in the CATEGORY 1, CATEGORY 2, and COUNT fields for the various aggregate security staff counts are listed.

:::note
The data reported in Category 1 and Category 2 must be reported in all UPPER CASE letters to pass validation. If you are reporting Category 2 = ZERO, you should have a single District fact record where Count = 0. You should not have records where both Category 2 = ZERO and Category 2 = TOTAL. If you are reporting Category 2 = TOTAL, then Count must be \> 0.
