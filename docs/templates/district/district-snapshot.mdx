## Template Description

For school districts and charter schools, Pennsylvania collects the starting age (in months) for the youngest kindergarten student (K4 or K5), as well as the cutoff date to reach minimum age for the program. 

**District Entry Minimum Age:** Populate this age field with the number of months (two digits) rather than the number of years. For example, if the minimum entry age is 5 years 0 months, upload 60.

**District Entry Cutoff Date:** Enter the last date on which a student may meet the minimum required age for entry into the earliest kindergarten program. The date is within the current school year, not the birth year.

**Kindergarten Program Type:** Populate this field with a two-digit code of K4 for a two-year kindergarten program or K5 for a one-year program.

:::note
Only one record per LEA will be required.
