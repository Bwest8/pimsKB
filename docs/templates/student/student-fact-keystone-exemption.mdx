## Template Description

This template defines the Student Fact table for Keystone Exemption and Non-numeric proficiency reporting. This data set is used to report students enrolled who were enrolled in in Keystone "trigger-equivalent" courses in the 2019-20 school year, who tested or would have tested in a 2019-20 school year Keystone testing window. 

LEAs will report whether the student would have been a first-time or repeat tester in the applicable subject area in the 2019-20 school year. 

LEAs will also report whether the student passed the Keystone "trigger-equivalent" course.

Students need not have been enrolled in the reporting LEA in the 2019-20 school year. Students who were enrolled in Keystone "trigger-equivalent" courses in the 2019-20 school year in another LEA (public, private, or out-of-state) may be reported by the LEA in which the student is enrolled in the reporting year. For example:

Student A was enrolled in a Keystone "trigger-equivalent" course in a private school in 2019-20 and transferred to a PIMS-reporting LEA for the 2023-24 school year. The PIMS-reporting LEA will report the student in the 2023-24 Keystone Exemption data set.
