# Appendix R – Calendar Program Codes

Calendar Program Code is Field 8 (CALENDAR PROGRAMS CODE) in the School Calendar Template. The purpose of the code is to identify a student’s days enrolled in a specific program. The data is used in subsidy calculations.

All School Calendars uploaded by a CTC, APS, or PRRI **must** include a Calendar Program Code.
