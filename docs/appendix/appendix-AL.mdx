# Appendix AL – Grad Status Codes

:::note
Appendix AL is for use with Field 65 (**GRAD STATUS**) in the Student Template.
:::

The codes listed below are only to be used for the Student Template. The Student Snapshot Template reports students who are in school on October 1 of the current year. These codes report the exit reason for a student and should not be recorded for a student who is still enrolled. Every student who exits an LEA for any reason should have the appropriate code from the table below recorded for Field 65 (Grad Status).

Local education agency (LEA) includes the following organization types: school district, charter and cyber charter school, career and technology center, state juvenile corrections institutions, intermediate unit, approved private school, and private residential rehabilitative institution.
