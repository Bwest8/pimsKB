# Introduction

The Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS) is a collaborative effort of the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) and local education agencies (LEA) across the commonwealth. PIMS is a statewide, longitudinal data system (SLDS) that efficiently and accurately manages, analyzes, disaggregates, and uses individual data for each student served by Pennsylvania’s pre-K through grade 12 public education system.

PIMS uses the eScholar data warehouse model, which stores data in a relational database. eScholar uses a standard set of templates that provides a consistent format for loading data from various information systems into the warehouse. By using templates, LEAs are not required to purchase new hardware or software. Modifications to information system software will be necessary to format data to meet template standards for file transmission. For additional information on eScholar, visit the [eScholar website](http://www.escholar.com/) (www.escholar.com).

PIMS serves many purposes, including:

-   Meeting current state and federal reporting requirements;
-   Improving education decision-making through the use of high-quality data and decision support tools;
-   Providing longitudinal tracking of education progress over time and across LEAs; and
-   Reporting timely and accurate education data through standardized and ad hoc reporting capabilities.

PIMS Manuals Year Definition:

-   2022-2023 – Previous Year
-   2023-2024 – Current Year

The following are significant initiatives for reporting:

## Every Student Succeeds Act

The federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), first passed in 1965. ESSA replaced the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), passed in 2002. The federal law advances ESEA’s promise of ensuring that all students – from pre-kindergarten to postsecondary, and especially low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities, English Learners, and other historically marginalized students – have access to a world-class education that prepares them for postsecondary education, career, and life.

On January 16, 2018, Pennsylvania’s Consolidated State ESSA Plan was approved by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE). Pennsylvania’s guiding principles within the State ESSA plan focus on transparency, equity, and innovative practices. An amended plan was approved by USDE on January 20, 2023.

As required by ESSA, Pennsylvania developed an accountability system using multiple academic indicators to determine Annual Meaningful Differentiation of all public schools in the commonwealth. Pennsylvania’s accountability plan is outlined in the Pennsylvania Consolidated State Plan. As part of the annual State Report Card, performance on the ESSA indicators will be posted for all students, as well as for multiple student groups, including economically disadvantaged students, English Learners, students receiving special education services, and major racial and ethnic groups. Specific to ESSA reporting, indicators for students in foster care, experiencing homelessness, and from military families will also be collected and reported as part of the State Report Card.

## Future Ready PA Index

An important component of Pennsylvania’s ESSA Consolidated State Plan is the Future Ready PA Index, a comprehensive, public-facing school progress report that includes a wide range of meaningful, evidence-based indicators. The Future Ready PA Index moves beyond a single, summative score to increase transparency around school and student group performance.

The [Future Ready PA Index](http://www.education.pa.gov/Pages/Future-Ready-PA.aspx) includes three main categories:

1.  State Assessment Measures
2.  On-Track Measures
3.  College and Career Measures

Future Ready PA Index data comes from the following sources:

## Act 13 Educator Effectiveness Building Level Score (BLS) 
(from the [Educator Effectiveness site](https://pdesas.org/Frameworks/DCEToolKit/Act13EvaluationOfEducatorEffectivenessToolkit))

Effective with the 2021-2022 school year, the Building Level Score (BLS) for evaluating educator effectiveness will be comprised of available **Assessment**<sup>5</sup>, **Growth**<sup>6</sup>, **Attendance Rate**<sup>7</sup>, and **Graduation Rate**<sup>8</sup> data and adjusted based on the percentage of economically disadvantaged students enrolled in the school (i.e., challenge multiplier) as follows:

1. Calculate the regression coefficient of determination (r2) that estimates the proportion of the variance in school-level data predictable by the percentage of students economically disadvantaged in a school.
2. Multiply the regression coefficient of determination by .1.
3. Multiply the product by the most currently available percentage of economically disadvantaged students in the school.
4. Multiply that product by 100.
5. Add the final product to the BLS.

Building Level Scores and information on how the building level data were derived are published annually, when available, at [Rating Tool Conversions](https://bit.ly/PAedEffective).

For information on how a BLS is converted to a rating for the purposes of evaluation, see [Rating Tool Conversions](https://pdesas.org/Frameworks/DCEToolKit/Act13EvaluationOfEducatorEffectivenessToolkit).

Building Level Data (BLD) are not attributed to professional employees serving as classroom teachers or as non-teaching professionals who are primarily assigned in a building or buildings within a school entity by which the professional is not employed. Additionally, BLD are never attributed to temporary professional employees serving as classroom teachers or as non-teaching professionals; both are evaluated using only the Observation & Practice measure.

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

Student education records are official, confidential records protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 USC 1232g). FERPA defines education records as all records, both paper and digital, that schools or education agencies maintain about students. FERPA and other privacy laws (such as Title I and Special Education) ensure that information about students collected by schools and government agencies is released only for specific and legally defined purposes.

Under FERPA Sec. 99.31 and 99.35, education agencies may release personally identifiable information to PDE for the purposes of auditing and evaluating education programs, and for complying with federal and state regulations. See Volume 2 of the PIMS User Manual for additional summary information on [FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html).
