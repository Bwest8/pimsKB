# Location Fact Template for Bus Evacuation Drills

**(22 Fields, 10 Collected, Delimited)**

**Target Table(s): `LOCATION_FACT`**

**Load Sequence/Dependencies:** No dependencies

## Template Description

The Bus Evacuation Drill Excel reporting tool is emailed to LEAs from PDE. The reporting tool consists of four rows for each location within the LEA, and three rows for the non-school School Number 9999. School Number 9999 is to be used to report drills held for students bussed to locations other than locations of the reporting LEA. Do not delete or add rows to the reporting tool.

The first row for each LEA location is for reporting the first day of school (Category 03 = FIRSTDAY). Enter Y in the Indicator field, and the date of the first day of school in the Date field.

The second row for each LEA location is used to indicate that no bus evacuation drills are required because students are not bussed to that location (Category 03 = NOBUS). Enter Y in the Indicator field if no bus drills are required, otherwise enter N.

The next two rows for each LEA location are for reporting whether drills were conducted in the fall (Category 03 = FALL) and during the month of March (Category 03 = MARCH). In the indicator field, enter a Y if a drill was held, otherwise enter N. If a drill was held, enter the date of the drill in the Date field. Date must be entered in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). If a required drill was not held, a brief explanation is required in the Comment field. In Excel, it may be necessary to format fields as text before entering data.

Some LEAs may bus students to off-site locations. Evacuation drills for students bussed to off-site locations are reported under the School Number 9999. This includes students regularly bussed to other locations such as IUs, CTCs, etc. This does not include student only bussed for field trips and similar activities.

The first row for the non-LEA location 9999 is used to indicate that no bus evacuation drills are required because students are not bussed to any off-site locations (Category 03 = NOBUS). Enter Y in the Indicator field if no bus drills are required, otherwise enter N. If a drill was not required, no explanation is required in the Comment field.

The next two rows for the non-LEA location 9999 are for reporting whether drills were conducted in the fall (Category 03 = FALL) and during the month of March (Category 03 = MARCH). In the indicator field, enter a Y if a drill was held, otherwise enter N. If a drill was held, enter the date of the drill in the Date field. If a required drill was not held, a brief explanation is required in the Comment field.

If a location has multiple drills on different days, the date that all drills were completed for the location should be used.
