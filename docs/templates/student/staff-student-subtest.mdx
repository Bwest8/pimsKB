### 10 - PERCENTAGE OF SHARED INSTRUCTION (INSTRUCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY WEIGHT)
<p><Badge color="required" /> <Badge color="updateable" /> <Badge length={3} /></p>

The percentage of content-specific instruction for a state assessment that a teacher is responsible for providing to an individual student. The PERCENTAGE OF SHARED INSTRUCTION (INSTRUCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY WEIGHT) will account for shared instruction of a student from Day One of the instruction (subject/grade/course) for the state assessment, up to and including the last school day before the LEAs testing window opens for that state assessment.  Zero will add the students to the "removed from roster". 1-100 will add the students to the teacher's roster.

:::warning[Business Rules:]
Whole number from `0` to and including `100`.  

**Example:**

This teacher splits instructional responsibility for a student that participates in the entire course 50/50 with another teacher; field is populated with `50`.

This teacher is the ONLY PA certified educator providing the content specific instruction of the assessed eligible content; field is populated with `100`. 

See the Instructional Responsibility section on the Roster Verification FAQ document on the [PVAAS website](https://pvaas.sas.com/) for further clarification.

### 11 - PERCENTAGE OF CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT (INSTRUCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WEIGHT)
<p><Badge color="required" /> <Badge color="updateable" /> <Badge length={3} /></p>

The percentage of days in which a student and a teacher are enrolled together (concurrently enrolled) for instruction for a state assessment, from Day One of the instruction (subject/grade/course) for the state assessment, up to and including the last school day before the LEAs testing window opens for that state assessment.   Zero will add the students to the "removed from roster." 1-100 will add the students to the teacher's roster.

:::warning[Business Rules:]
Whole number from `0` to and including `100`.  

**Example:**

Teacher and student are concurrently enrolled for 35 days in a 140 day course (25 percent of the course); field is populated with `25`.  

See the Instructional Responsibility section the Roster Verification FAQ document on the [PVAAS website](https://pvaas.sas.com/) for further clarification.
