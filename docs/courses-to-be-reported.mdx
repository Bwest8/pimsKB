# Courses to be Reported in PIMS

LEAs are required to submit all courses, course instructor assignments, and student course enrollments, in all academic subject areas for both elementary and secondary. To meet federal reporting requirements, LEAs are expected to map all local courses to state course codes (PIMS \> Manuals and Calendar \> Course Codes – App A).

## Course Records

Course records should be created for all academic courses taught to public school students from Pre-K to grade 12. All courses should be mapped to an appropriate state course code in the standardized state course code list in PIMS \> Manuals and Calendar \> Course Codes – App A.

## What LEA should report a Course?

It is important to know the course content an LEA’s students are receiving as well as who is providing that content. As such, an LEA is required to report all courses in which their students are enrolled. In certain situations, LEAs’ contract services from another LEA that reports to PIMS. Who reports the Staff and Course data related to these contracts depends on the type of contracted services. More information on who reports Course data can be found in the [How-To Guide](https://www.education.pa.gov/DataAndReporting/PIMS/Resources/Pages/HowtoGuides.aspx).

## Mapping of Local Courses to State Course Codes

PDE uses the National Forum on Education Statistics’ School Codes for the Exchange of Data (SCED) as a base list for state course codes. LEAs should map their local course codes to the state course code that most closely matches the content covered in the course. SCED code definitions can be found on the National Center for Education Statistics [(NCES) website](http://nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp) (nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp).

LEAs are required to report all courses, in all subject areas, and course enrollments in sections taught by instructors who are employed by the LEA, as well as dual credit courses in which the instructor is employed by a postsecondary institution.
