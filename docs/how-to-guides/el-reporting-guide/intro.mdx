# English Learner (EL) Reporting How-to Guide

## Overview

The EL Reporting How-to Guide provides essential information on reporting English Learner (EL) data, as mandated by the federal government and required by Pennsylvania's Department of Education (PDE). This document serves as a reference for LEAs responsible for maintaining data quality in PIMS for all EL-related reporting requirements.

## Executive Summary

The October Student Data Set includes critical demographics such as low-income, immigrant, special education, and English learner data. This dataset serves as the official school enrollment count for the year and is mandated by federal requirements.

:::info Important Reporting Requirements
Local Education Agencies (LEAs) must ensure data accuracy by reviewing and submitting the data to the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) within the October collection window's deadline.
:::

### Key Uses of EL Data

- Graduation, dropout, and cohort calculations
- Teacher Loan Forgiveness (TCLI) program eligibility
- Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) for food program participation
- Statewide public reporting on student demographics

:::note Impact
Accurate EL data reporting is essential for various educational programs, funding allocation, and analytical purposes. LEA personnel responsible for PIMS-related data must collaborate closely to review, edit, and verify all information prior to final submission.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>How should pre-K EL students be handled upon entering kindergarten?</summary>

Pre-K students identified as EL must be screened when they enter kindergarten. If they do not meet the criteria for EL status after screening, their status can be changed to `99 - Never EL`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How are nonpublic students included in Title III services?</summary>

Nonpublic students receive Title III services only if they participate in Title III within their LEA's boundaries. LEAs must consult with nonpublic schools to confirm participation and allocate Title III services appropriately.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If a student has exited EL services, are they still required to take ACCESS for ELLs tests?</summary>

Yes. Students who have exited EL services are required to participate in ACCESS for ELLs testing as part of annual federal requirements.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How should an LEA report a student as "Current EL" when parents have refused services?</summary>

Report the student as EL in Field 41 with `01` (Current EL) or `06` (Current EL - LIFE), even if parents have opted out. Set LIEP Type (Field 45) to `27 - Parent refusal`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can a student previously identified as EL be re-identified if they struggle academically?</summary>

Yes. If a student who exited EL services faces academic challenges related to language, re-identification is warranted. Review the guidelines for reclassification, monitoring, and re-designation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if a student moves out of the U.S. and later re-enrolls?</summary>

The calculation for Years in US Schools is cumulative, so time spent in the U.S. prior to the move would count towards their total upon re-enrollment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do all immigrant students need to be coded as EL?</summary>

No. A student may qualify as an immigrant without meeting the criteria for EL. Immigrant status is based on birth location and enrollment history, while EL status is determined by language proficiency screenings.
