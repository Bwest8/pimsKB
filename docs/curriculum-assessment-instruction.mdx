# Curriculum, Assessment, and Instruction

## Division of Assessment and Accountability (DAA)

Pennsylvania's accountability system, as required by ESSA, is administered by the PDE Bureau of Curriculum, Assessment, and Instruction. The Division of Assessment and Accountability is responsible for the development, administration, scoring, and reporting of the state's PSSA and Keystone assessments and provides guidance to schools and LEAs on assessment and accountability reporting.

The bureau's other assessment and accountability functions include:

- Evaluating LEA, school, and student progress and reporting school performance for compliance with federal and state requirements
- Developing assessment anchors to better align curricula, instruction, and assessment practices
- Coordinating test development, administration, and reporting
- Providing technical assistance for statewide and local assessment systems

During the 2018-19 school year, Pennsylvania transitioned to a new statewide accountability system aligned to federal ESSA requirements. In Pennsylvania, the Future Ready PA Index is the state's accountability system. The Future Ready PA Index uses a dashboard model to highlight how schools are performing and making progress on multiple indicators. The reporting system moves beyond a single, summative score to increase transparency around school and student group performance.

Future Ready PA Index provides publicly accessible data on academic achievement, academic growth, high school graduation rate, regular attendance (related to chronic absenteeism in ESSA), college and career readiness, and information on English Learner proficiency, among other indicators. Although there are many indicators, the DAA's focus is on the Statewide Assessment Measures, which include English Language Arts (ELA), math and science for the PSSA and PASA, and the Algebra, Literature and Biology Keystone Exam data across eleven student subgroups.

For more information on the Future Ready PA Index, visit the [PDE website](http://www.education.pa.gov/).

The DAA will continue to publish building-level data for the purposes of educator evaluation pursuant to Section 1138.1 of the Public School Code.

## Authorization

Chapter 4 (relating to Academic Standards) of Title 22 of the Pennsylvania Code authorizes the reporting of assessment data.

- Students must test in state assessments, including the PSSAs, Keystone Exams, or PASAs.
- Students must take Keystone Exams by the Spring of their grade 11 year.

## PSSA

**Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA)** includes assessments in English Language Arts and Mathematics which are taken by students in grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Students in grades 5 and 8 are administered the Science PSSA. The English Language Arts and Mathematics PSSAs include items that are consistent with the Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics. The Science PSSA includes items that are aligned to the Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content aligned to the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Science.

## Keystone Exams

**Keystone Exams** are end-of-course assessments in designated content areas. The Keystone Exams serve two purposes:
1. High school accountability assessments for federal and state purposes
2. One part of a system of high school graduation requirements for students beginning with the class of 2021

The Algebra I and Literature Keystone Exams include items written to the Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards in Mathematics and English Language Arts. The Biology Keystone Exam includes items written to the Assessment Anchor/Eligible Content aligned to the enhanced Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Science.

## Attribution Map and PDE Attribution Rules

The Attribution Map and PDE Attribution rules are posted on the Pennsylvania Accountability System website. The Attribution Map describes the school and LEA responsible for ensuring student participation in the state assessment, ordering test materials, and administering the tests. It also explains how PSSA, PASA, and grade 11 Keystone Exam scores and participation will be attributed for accountability purposes.

These documents are updated annually. The updated Attribution Map will be posted prior to the Grades 3-8 (PSSA and PASA) and Grade 11 (Keystone) Attribution Windows in DRC's eDIRECT system. All communication regarding Attributions is communicated by DRC to the Assessment Coordinators in the school or district. Access to the eDIRECT is password protected and determined by the LEA's Chief Administrative Officer.

In order to submit accurate data for the Accountability Internal Snapshots, PIMS Administrators are advised to use the PDE Attribution Rules supplement that is posted along with the Attribution Map on the [PAS webpage](http://www.education.pa.gov/pas).

## Trainings

Trainings are posted on the PAS webpage and include a brief recorded webinar and PowerPoint presentation in advance of the live Q&A. All attendees are expected to have viewed the recorded webinar and PowerPoint prior to attending the live Q&A. All trainings are conducted by the Division of Assessment and Accountability and are posted on the PAS webpage.

Training dates are posted with the PIMS Calendar and email broadcasts are sent to all PIMS Administrators. It is the LEA's responsibility to update the PIMS Administrators who are designated by the LEA to receive PDE communications regarding trainings. To update the PIMS Administrators' list, please contact your LEA's MyPDESuite Local security administrator.
