-   Several programs will be tracked directly on the student record. Please refer to the Student and Student Snapshot Templates for specific details and code sets for these programs:
    -   IEP (Not Gifted)
    -   Plan 504
-   Some programs may be tracked in aggregate at the IU level, not the student level. Please refer to the District Annual Facts Template for specific details on how to collect this information. Currently these include:
    -   EP Service Plan
-   Some programs may be tracked at the school level, not the student level. Currently these include:
    -   Project 720
-   Students coded here as 055 and 056 should also have a nighttime status recorded in the Program Fact Template, Field 18.
-   The McKinney-Vento Act defines the term "homeless children and youths" as individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.
-   Mode of Instruction: This is the manner in which an instructional program is delivered in a given time period. Modes of instruction include fully in-person, hybrid, and fully virtual/remote.
-   The Education for Homeless Youth Basic Education Circular (BEC) explains the categories of children who are "homeless" and entitled to the protections of the federal law. These categories include:
    -   children and youths who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; or are abandoned in hospitals;
    -   children and youths who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings;
    -   children and youths who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings; and

“migratory children” who qualify as homeless under federal law because the children are living in circumstances described in clauses (i) through (iii) above. The term "migratory children" means children who are (or whose parent(s) or spouse(s) are) migratory agricultural workers, including migratory dairy workers or migratory fishermen, and who have moved from one school district to another in the preceding 36 months, in order to obtain (or accompany such parents or spouses in order to obtain) temporary or seasonal employment in agricultural or fishing work.
