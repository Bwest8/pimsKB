# Course - Rigor Course Code / Indicator Field Agreement Check

**ERROR FILENAME**: `rule_306`

## Description

This data quality rule checks for mismatches in course characteristics between the template file and PIMS. The rule ensures that the values for the following columns in the Course template file agree with the corresponding state course values in PIMS ([Appendix A](../appendix/appendix-A.mdx)):

**Template:** [Course](../templates/course/course.mdx)

- Field 32 - [DUAL CREDIT](../templates/course/#32---dual-credit)
- Field 33 - [ADVANCED PLACEMENT INDICATOR](../templates/course/#33---advanced-placement-indicator)
- Field 40 - [INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE INDICATOR](../templates/course/#40---international-baccalaureate-indicator)
- Field 97 - [CAMBRIDGE ADVANCED COURSE INDICATOR](../templates/course/#79---cambridge-advanced-course-indicator)

## How the Rule Works

When you upload a file, the data quality engine will compare the values in the specified columns between the template file and state values in PIMS. It retrieves the state values using the provided Field 29 - [ALTERNATE COURSE CODE](../templates/course/#29---alternate-course-code) from the submitted template. The rule will identify and flag any records containing discrepancies between the course characteristics and the corresponding state values.

**The rule checks for the following conditions:**

| Template File Field                             | Template File Value | PIMS Column                  | PIMS State Value |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------| 
| Field 32 `DUAL CREDIT`                          | `N`                 | `DUAL_CREDIT`                | `NO`       |
| Field 32 `DUAL CREDIT`                          | `Y`                 | `DUAL_CREDIT`                | `YES`      |
| Field 33 `ADVANCED PLACEMENT INDICATOR`         | `N`                 | `AP_IND`                     | `NO`       |
| Field 33 `ADVANCED PLACEMENT INDICATOR`         | `Y`                 | `AP_IND`                     | `YES`      |
| Field 40 `INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE INDICATOR`| `N`                 | `IB_IND`                     | `NO`       |
| Field 40 `INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE INDICATOR`| `Y`                 | `IB_IND`                     | `YES`      |
| Field 97 `CAMBRIDGE ADVANCED COURSE INDICATOR`  | `N`                 | `OTHER_CHARACTERISTIC_IND`   | `NO`       |
| Field 97 `CAMBRIDGE ADVANCED COURSE INDICATOR`  | `Y`                 | `OTHER_CHARACTERISTIC_IND`   | `YES`      |

The rule checks that the values in the specified fields of the template file match the corresponding values in PIMS. If there is a mismatch, the rule will flag the record for review and correction.

## What to Expect

When you upload a file, the data quality engine will run the "**Course - Rigor Course Code / Indicator Field Agreement Check**" rule and provide feedback on any records that do not meet the expected conditions. If there are mismatches in the course characteristics between the template file and PIMS, those records will be flagged for review and correction.

:::note

To ensure a smooth data upload process, please make sure that the course characteristics values are consistent across both the template file and PIMS before uploading your file. This will help maintain data integrity and avoid any issues during the data quality check process.

## Error Messages

If there are mismatches in the course characteristics between the template file and the state values in PIMS, you may encounter one or more of the following error messages:

```
Course Record: Course Code Long:`XXX`; Alternate Course Code:`XXX`; Dual Credit Indicator:`XXX` does not match the state value:`XXX`

Course Record: Course Code Long:`XXX`; Alternate Course Code:`XXX`; Advanced Placement Indicator:`XXX` does not match the state value:`XXX`

Course Record: Course Code Long:`XXX`; Alternate Course Code:`XXX`; International Baccalaureate Indicator:`XXX` does not match the state value:`XXX`

Course Record: Course Code Long:`XXX`; Alternate Course Code:`XXX`; Cambridge Advanced Course Indicator:`XXX` does not match the state value:`XXX`
```

In these error messages, `XXX` represents the actual values from your template file and PIMS. The message indicates which specific course characteristic does not match between the two data sources.

:::warning[Important]
If you receive any of these error messages, review the flagged records in your template file and ensure that the corresponding course characteristic value matches the one in PIMS. Correct any discrepancies and re-upload the file.
