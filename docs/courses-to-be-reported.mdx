## Course Code Mapping

### State Course Codes

PDE uses the National Forum on Education Statistics' School Codes for the Exchange of Data (SCED) as the base for state course codes.

### Mapping Process

1. Identify the state course code that most closely matches your local course content
2. Use SCED code definitions from the [NCES website](http://nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp)
