**\*** Students with IEPs who participate in (take) the Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment (PASA) in lieu of an approved state academic assessment are granted a waiver on the PDE approved end-of-program technical skills assessment, as long as the PASA being required for the student is documented in the student’s IEP. Therefore, IEP students **participating in PASA** can be considered as “completing the CTE program” as long as appropriate student IEP CTE program-related objectives are met.
