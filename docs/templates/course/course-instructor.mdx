## Template Description

The Course Instructor Template is used to identify the instructor(s) of each section of every course reported in the Course Template. The Course Instructor Template should be submitted in a cumulative fashion so that the primary instructor associated with each section and each course are reported for the entire school year. All active teachers and teachers on long term leave should have course instructor records. Teachers who are terminated during the school year are not reported unless the course they were teaching also ended with their departure. Retired teachers may be reported if they taught a portion of the class prior to their retirement. Long term substitutes are reported when they are the teacher of record, or when they are a professional or temporary professional employee.
