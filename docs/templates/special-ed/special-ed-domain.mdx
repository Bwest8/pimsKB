# Special Education Domain

All Pennsylvania school districts and charter schools must submit the following templates as part of the Special Education Data Collection:

- **[Student Template](docs/templates/student/student.mdx)**
- **[Special Education Snapshot Template](docs/templates/special-ed/special-education-snapshot.mdx)**  

:::warning
A corresponding Student Template record must exist for each student record in the Special Education Snapshot. The DQE will determine if a student record has been uploaded by the Special Education Reporting LEA for the current school year. If no student record exists, an error will be generated.
