## Template Description

This template defines the Student Award Fact table. This table contains data related to the Industry-Recognized Credentials awarded to and Work-Based Learning Experiences engaged in by students in grades 7 through 12.

The Industry-Based Learning Indicator identifies the percentage of 12th graders who demonstrate meaningful engagement in exploration and preparation in industry-based technical skills within grades 7 through 12 prior to graduation. The [Industry-Based Learning Indicator guidance document](https://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/ESSA/FutureReady/Pages/FRIndustryGuidelines.aspx) (located at Pennsylvania Department of Education > K-12 > ESSA > [Industry-Based Learning Indicator for the Future Ready PA Index: Guidelines for Data Collection, Monitoring, and Reporting](https://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/ESSA/FutureReady/Pages/FRIndustryGuidelines.aspx)) provides additional information for data collection, reporting, and monitoring. Non-CTE students will enter "ICN" for Industry-Recognized Credential or "WBL" for Work-Based Learning experiences in Field 5 and the associated work-based learning experience code in Field 4, as noted in the guidance document.
