## Template Description

This template defines the Student Fact table for Career Standards Benchmarks. This table contains data (Y or N indicator) related to the students in grades 5, 8, and 11 expected to meet the benchmarks identified in State Board of Education regulations, pertaining to Career Education and Work Standards (CEW Standards). This schoolwide indicator represents a calculated percent of students who demonstrate engagement in career exploration, preparation, and implementation of individualized career plans through separate, specific measures based on grade level. The reporting requirements are as follows:

- Grade 5 benchmark—6 pieces of evidence
- Grade 8 benchmark—6 pieces of evidence, including a career plan
- Grade 11 benchmark—8 pieces of evidence, including the portfolio and evidence that demonstrates career plan implementation.

The four strands of the CEW Standards should be addressed at least once in the benchmark collection. Additional information about the Career Readiness Indicator can be found in the [Guidance document](https://www.education.pa.gov/Documents/About%20PDE/FutureReadyPA/Future%20Ready%20PA%20Index%20Career%20Readiness%20Guidance%20V2.pdf).
