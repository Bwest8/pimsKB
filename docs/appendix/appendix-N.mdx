## Definitions:

**AUN**: The unique, 9-digit Administrative Unit Number assigned by PDE.
:::note
If a student is enrolled in a magnet school within their District of Residence, the School Number of Residence should be the magnet school.
:::

**District of Residence AUN**: The AUN for the school district where the natural/adoptive parent or legal guardian resides. For a 1305 or 1306 student with no known school district of residence, enter the PA State code (999999999). Students whose natural/adoptive parent resides out-of-state should use the Out-of-State code (888888888).

**Funding District AUN**: The AUN for the school district that is financially responsible for the student. This is generally the same as District of Residence, except for non-resident students as noted in the appendix below.

**AUN of Enrollment:** The AUN for the LEA providing the majority of the student’s core academic education.

:::note

-   A value of 888888888 should be entered to indicate the generic “Out-of-State” code.
-   A value of 999999999 should be entered to indicate the generic “PA State” code.
-   Letters A to M are values for the Residence Status Code field in the School Enrollment Template (Field 10) and Student Calendar Fact Template (Field 7).
-   Reporting Adult Affidavit Program (AAP) students in the School Enrollment Template is not required or needed. LEAs may report 999999999 in the District Code of Residence and should report the AUN of the school district where the CTE educating LEA is located in the Funding District AUN for AAP students.

:::note
Codes apply to all grade levels **with the exception of Adult Affidavit Program (AAP) students.** Reporting Adult Affidavit Program (AAP) students in the School Enrollment Template is not required or needed. LEAs may report “999999999” in the District Code of Residence and should report the AUN of the school district where the CTE educating LEA is located in the Funding District AUN for AAP students.
