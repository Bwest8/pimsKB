# Career and Technical Education (CTE) Domain

Only LEAs with PDE-approved reimbursable secondary CTE programs or registered adult affidavit programs offered by their schools during the reporting year are required to submit the following templates in the CTE Domain, as appropriate:

-   **CTE Student Fact Template** – Submit only if LEA had reportable enrollees in approved reimbursable secondary CTE programs and/or registered adult affidavit programs.
-   **CTE Student Industry Credential Template** – Submit only if CTE (secondary and/or adult affidavit) program enrollees earned reportable industry certifications.

Do not report any students enrolled in, Career Exploration/Awareness Skills programs **or any adults enrolled in secondary program classes (adult intergenerational programs)** within these templates. See CTE Student Fact Template Description for further guidance concerning what students to report as CTE students.

## Reporting Secondary CTE Students

If a school has PDE-reimbursable CTE program approvals in place for the reporting year but does not have any CTE student enrollments to report within **all** of an LEAs approved reimbursable CTE programs, notify the Office of Data Quality at [ra-catsdata@pa.gov](mailto:ra-catsdata@pa.gov).

In addition to these CTE templates, all **required** data elements within the June 30 Student Snapshot Template and School Enrollment Template must also be submitted for secondary CTE students for an LEA. Be aware that there are Student Snapshot Template data elements that are conditionally required specifically for secondary CTE students. Those elements include the address fields (Fields 16 – 20) along with the STUDENT IS A SINGLE PARENT (Field 120) and OUT OF WORKFORCE INDIVIDUAL (Field 166). Note the following grade levels (Field 10, CURRENT GRADE LEVEL, within Student Snapshot Data elements) are considered valid for secondary CTE students:

-   `009` – Grade 9
-   `010` – Grade 10
-   `011` – Grade 11
-   `012` – Grade 12

Refer to the Student Domain and Enrollment Domain sections of the user manual for additional information on each Student Snapshot and School Enrollment Template data element. The PIMS Summer Submission (June 30) Student Snapshot Template and School Enrollment Template data must be submitted and processed to support the CTE Domain template student data.

## Reporting Adult Affidavit CTE Students

If a school has PDE-registered adult affidavit CTE programs in place for the reporting year but does not have any adult affidavit CTE student enrollments to report within **all** an LEAs adult affidavit CTE programs, notify the Office of Data Quality at [ra-catsdata@pa.gov](mailto:ra-catsdata@pa.gov).

In addition to these CTE templates, specific data elements within the June 30 Student Snapshot Template must be accurately populated to accommodate state adult CTE accountability statistics. **Reporting adult affidavit students in the School Enrollment Template is not required.** Be aware that there are Student Snapshot Template data elements that are conditionally required specifically for adult affidavit CTE students. Those elements include the address fields (Fields 16 – 20) along with the STUDENT IS A SINGLE PARENT (Field 120) and OUT OF WORKFORCE INDIVIDUAL (Field 166). Use the following grade level (Field 10 within Student Snapshot Data elements) to report CTE adult affidavit program students:

**AAP – Adult Affidavit Program Student:** Refer to the Student Domain section of the user manual for additional information on Student Snapshot Template data elements. The PIMS Summer Submission (June 30) Student Snapshot Template must be submitted and processed to support the CTE Domain template adult affidavit student data.

:::note
Submit June 30 CTE Student Snapshot data **only** if LEA had reportable enrollees in PDE-approved reimbursable secondary CTE programs and/or registered adult affidavit programs. The June 30 CTE Student Snapshot must, at a minimum, include a comprehensive list of students enrolled (at any point during the reporting year) in PDE-approved, reimbursable secondary CTE programs and/or registered adult affidavit programs held (owned) and operated by the LEA.
