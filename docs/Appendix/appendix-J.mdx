# Appendix J – Language Codes

Language Codes are found on the Language Codes – Appendix J spreadsheet on the Pennsylvania Department of Education \> Data and Reporting \> PIMS \> [Manuals and Calendar](https://www.education.pa.gov/DataAndReporting/PIMS/ManualsCalendar/Pages/default.aspx) page.

Use the NCES language code. A language can have multiple names, depending on the local dialect that is spoken. The list mentioned above contains only the NCES standard language names, not any local variants.

If you are unable to find a language in the list mentioned above, please use this site to research the language, to see if variants of its name exist: [Ethnologue website](http://www.ethnologue.com/).

:::note
Appendix J is for use with Field 20 (PRIMARY INSTRUCTION LANGUAGE CODE) in the Course Instructor Template and Field 123 (HOME LANGUAGE CODE) in the Student and Student Snapshot Template, and in Category 3 of the LIEP Survey, if an LEA has a bilingual program.
