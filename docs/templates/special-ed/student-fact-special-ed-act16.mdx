## Template Description

For the previous school year, identify the educational expenditure cost range category (see [Appendix AJ](docs/appendix/appendix-AJ.mdx)) for each student with disabilities. The expenditure range is based on the total cost of the student's special education program directed by an individualized education program (IEP) for the entire school year (7/1 through 6/30).

The template should be submitted by the School District of Residence, NOT by the educating LEA, IU, APS, county prison, CTC, or other entity.

Exceptions:

- Students enrolled in a charter school are reported by the charter school.
- 1305 (Foster Home) students are reported by the school district in which the student resides with the foster parents.
- Students educated in state adult and state juvenile correctional facilities are reported by the PA Department of Corrections Education.
- Gifted students are not included in this submission.
