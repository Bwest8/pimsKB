## Template Description
This template connects one or multiple victims to each specific incident. In cases of incidents when there are crimes against property, such as vandalism in Field 5 of this template, Valid Value 8 (school/school facility) should be used. Note that not all incidents will have a victim. For example, a fighting incident will not have a victim (all parties are considered offenders in this case). See [Appendix Z](docs/appendix/appendix-Z.mdx) for more information (the "Infraction has Victims" column). If there are no victims associated with the incident, do not submit any records in this template.
