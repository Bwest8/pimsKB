## Template Description
This template defines the primary details of both offenders and victims.

Note that this template can be used to individually identify a victim or offender as it contains fields for the PAsecureID (Field 5) and name (Fields 7 and 8). LEAs, however, do not need to identify a victim individually using these fields. LEAs can elect to keep the victim anonymous by using an LEA-created ID instead of the PAsecureID to populate these fields within this template for victims. Note that the gender and race/ethnicity of the person is required if known.

The person, if known or unknown, must be individually identified within this template. The PAsecureID must be submitted in Field 5 if the offender is a known current student. If the offender is not a current student, the first and last name should be entered in Fields 7 and 8. In the cases that an offender is unknown the LEA should use an identifier assigned by the LEA.
