## Template Description

This template defines the CTE Student Fact table. This table contains the primary details of each CTE student's enrollment within a PDE-approved school-level CTE program and/or registered adult affidavit CTE operated by each LEA. 

This template serves to accommodate PDE data collection requirements for federal (Perkins V) accountability requirements, and PDE's need to account for students that enroll in or complete approved reimbursable secondary CTE programs and/or registered adult affidavit programs.

### Reporting Secondary CTE Students

Report all secondary students within this template who: 
1. were enrolled in the technical component of a PDE-approved reimbursable secondary CTE program during the reporting year, AND;
2. completed and signed "Annual Educational and Occupational Objectives for Students Enrolled in a PDE Approved CTE Program" form (PDE-408) or a similar locally developed form directly related to the student's enrollment in the CTE program reported within Field 6 (CIP Code) of this template. 

The student's completed and signed PDE-408 form (or similar form) must be on file with the LEA that holds (owns) the approved CTE program in which the student is reported as enrolled.

:::note
Do **not** report secondary students within the CTE Student Fact Template who:
1. lack appropriate signed educational and occupational objectives (PDE-408 form or similar form), 
2. are taking one career and technical education course without intending to pursue the approved program of study as indicated by an appropriate complete educational and occupational objective form (PDE-408 or similar form), or
3. are taking a career and technical education course in order to explore careers.
:::

:::warning[IMPORTANT NOTE:]

LEAs with students enrolled in 2021-2022 PDE approved reimbursable secondary CTE programs held (owned) and operated by the LEA need to submit this template. 


- A secondary CTE student may only be reported once at the CIP SCHOOL NUMBER (SCHOOL)-LEVEL within this template. 
- A secondary student may be reported more than once within this template only if the student was enrolled in approved CTE programs within more than one school (CIP SCHOOL NUMBER) within an LEA during the reporting year.
:::

## Reporting Adult Affidavit CTE Students

Report all students enrolled in registered adult (only) affidavit CTE programs that meet state program standards/requirements and were submitted and registered as operational in the Career and Technical Education Information System ([CATS](http://www.catsv2.pa.gov/Screens/Login/wfPublicHome.aspx)) for this reporting year. **Do not report adult students enrolled in secondary programs (adult intergenerational programs).** Adult affidavit programs are **adult only** programs.

CATS registered adult affidavit programs **do not include:**
- Enrichment/hobby-type programs for personal benefit that are not job related and that do not contribute to a person's occupational objective;
- Programs in Adult Basic Education (ABE), Standard Evening High School (SEHS) or General Education Development (GED) unless the program also meets Career and Technical Education requirements;
- State-funded Customized Job Training Programs (CJT); 
- Programs funded 100% with federal monies (e.g. Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act);
- 100% employer-funded programs; or
- Any program not open to the public.

CATS registered adult affidavit programs should include the following program types:
- Registered Apprenticeship: a program for adults enrolled in a registered apprenticeship program involving on-the-job training.
- Emergency Service: a program for adults in voluntary public emergency service (e.g. Emergency Medical Technology and Firefighting).
- Other Occupational: a program for adults enrolled in a career and technical program for new occupational preparation or to upgrade their skills.

Questions related to the CTE adult affidavit registration process should be directed to the Bureau of Career and Technical Education at (717) 783-6996.

:::warning[IMPORTANT NOTE:]
LEAs with students enrolled in 2021-2022 PDE registered adult (only) affidavit programs held (owned) and operated by the LEA need to submit this template. 

**An adult affidavit CTE student may be reported more than once within this template to document each registered adult affidavit program the student was actively enrolled in during the reporting year.**
:::

:::info[**IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTE**]
This template is designed to accommodate both secondary and AAP CTE students. LEAs need to develop data extracts to accommodate the 36-field layout of this template for BOTH secondary and AAP student records.

Refer to the technical component of the approved program's scope and sequence in the Career and Technical Information System (CATS).

**ADULT AFFIDAVIT STUDENTS:** The cumulative percent of the (normally scheduled) total CTE program technical hours the student successfully completed (passed) for the student's reported program CIP (Field 6). **Adult Affidavit Example 1:** If adult affidavit program normally operates over the span of 1 year, the percent reported is a percent of the total program technical hours normally offered over 1 year. **Adult Affidavit Example 2:** If adult affidavit program normally operates over a 6-week period, the percent reported is a percent of total program technical hours normally offered over the 6-week period.
