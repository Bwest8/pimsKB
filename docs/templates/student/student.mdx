The end of year Student Template submission must be a cumulative submission. All students, regardless of whether or not they were active on a PDE reporting date, must be included in the end of year submission.

This field indicates the economically disadvantaged status of a student and is used to provide the economically disadvantaged disaggregation. 

Informs various indicators in the **[Future Ready PA Index](/docs/intro#future-ready-pa-index)**.

To determine if a student is economically disadvantaged, the following poverty data sources may be used:

- Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cases
- Census poor
- Medicaid
- Children living in institutions for the neglected or delinquent
- Those supported in foster homes

If such data are not available, use the most recent reliable data available at the time of determination, such as free and reduced-price lunch eligibility.

For Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) schools:
- Do not use free and reduced-price lunch eligibility to determine a student's economic status.
- By definition, all students in CEP schools are to be reported as food program eligible (Field 131 of the Student and Student Snapshot Templates).

In addition to using other poverty source data indicators, LEAs with **AAP** CTE enrollees should populate with `Y` if the AAP student is eligible to receive a Pell grant or comparable state need-based financial assistance.
