# District Fact - Staff Vacancy Date Validation

**ERROR FILENAME:** `rule_staff_vacancy_date_validation`

## Understanding the Rule

This rule ensures that the [START DATE](docs/templates/district/district-fact-quarterly-vacancy-updates.mdx#19---start-date) (field 19) in your [DISTRICT_FACT](docs/templates/district/district-fact-quarterly-vacancy-updates.mdx) submission aligns with the official start date for the reporting quarter. It also verifies that your submission falls within the allowed time frame.

## How It Works

The rule performs two primary checks:

1. **Submission Timing**: Verifies that your data submission occurs within the designated time frame for the quarter.

2. **Start Date Accuracy**: Ensures the Start Date in your file matches the official start date for the reporting quarter.

**Key Information**

The quarter (`CATEGORY_06`) and school year (`REPORTING_DATE`) are crucial for determining the correct start date. Ensure these fields are accurately populated.

## About the District Fact Template

The District Fact Template is used to report vacancies for full-time and part-time professional staff positions as of the Start Date for each quarter. A vacancy is defined as any unfilled position that has been approved and posted for hiring.
