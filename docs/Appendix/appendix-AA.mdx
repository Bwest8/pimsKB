# Appendix AA – Categories to Use in the Location  Fact Template for Safe Schools

The tables below detail the values to use in the CATEGORY 1 – CATEGORY 4 fields as well as the COUNT field when reporting habitual truancy and the indication of no reportable School Safety incidents.

:::note

-   The CATEGORY 4 field does not apply to the habitual truancy data or the indication of no reportable School Safety incidents. In these situations, leave this field blank.
-   The grade level codes used are the same as the CURRENT GRADE LEVEL field within the Student and Student Snapshot Templates.
-   The ethnicity codes used are the same as the ETHNIC CODE SHORT field within the Student and Student Snapshot Templates.
-   The data reported in Category 1 and Category 2 must be reported in all UPPER-CASE letters to pass validation.

## Indication of No Reportable School Safety Incidents for a School

Reportable School Safety incidents are to be submitted in detail in the Discipline Domain Templates. Some schools (most often elementary schools) may not have any reportable School Safety incidents for the entire school year. In this situation an LEA must indicate this by submitting a record in the Location Fact Template for each school that does not have reportable incidents for the year. Use the categories in the table below.

| Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Description of what to include in COUNT field                                                                          |
|------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INCIDENTS`  | `ZERO`       | `ZERO`       | Include 0 to indicate that the school did not have any reportable School Safety incidents for the entire school year.  |
