This domain only applies to the following organizational types:
- School Districts
- Intermediate Units
- Career and Technical Centers
- Charter Schools
- Private Residential Rehabilitation Institutions (PRRI)
- Approved Private Schools (APS)

## Template Description

This template is used to associate a student's membership days with a unique calendar uploaded in the School Calendar file. A student will have more than one record in the Student Calendar Fact file if he or she was withdrawn and reentered due to a change in one of the following key fields:

- [Calendar ID](#3---calendar-id)
- [District of Residence AUN](#5---district-of-residence-aun)
- [Funding District AUN](#6---funding-district-aun)
- [Residence Status Code](#7---residence-status-code)
- [Current Grade Level](#11---grade)
- [Special Education Indicator](#15---special-education-indicator)

The [Days Enrolled](#8---days-enrolled) and [Percentage of Time Enrolled for Calendar](#10---percentage-of-time-enrolled-for-calendar) fields are used to calculate Average Daily Membership (ADM). 

The [Days Present](#9---days-present) and [Percentage of Time Enrolled for Calendar](#10---percentage-of-time-enrolled-for-calendar) fields are used to calculate Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for each record.


## Additional Information

**Field 5 - [DISTRICT OF RESIDENCE AUN](#5---district-of-residence-aun), Field 6 - [FUNDING DISTRICT AUN](#6---funding-district-aun) & Field 7 - [RESIDENCE STATUS CODE](#7---residence-status-code)**

These key fields are used to identify the school district receiving ADM for state subsidies. Refer to [Appendix N](docs/appendix/appendix-N.mdx) for guidance on populating these important fields.

Uploading multiple Student Calendar Fact records, a common error made by LEAs attempting to correct a key field, results in duplicated membership days. It is important to remove the erroneous records by submitting a PIMS Data Maintenance Request form to PDE for a delete. Run the Student Calendar Fact Validation Report called “Students with Multiple Calendar Fact Records” to identify duplicated membership days.

---
**Field 8 - [DAYS ENROLLED](#8---days-enrolled) & Field 9 - [DAYS PRESENT](#9---days-present)** 

These fields are updatable. The days are not prorated. The Percentage of Time Enrolled in Calendar field is used to prorate or calculate equivalent days enrolled. See examples below.

---
**Field 10 - [PERCENTAGE OF TIME ENROLLED FOR CALENDAR](#10---percentage-of-time-enrolled-for-calendar)** 

Percent is used to prorate membership if it is less than full time. PIMS calculates equivalent days enrolled by multiplying Days Enrolled by the Percentage of Time Enrolled for Calendar. Equivalent days enrolled divided by days in session equals ADM. Equivalent days present is calculated by multiplying Days Present by the Percentage of Time Enrolled for Calendar. Equivalent days present divided by days in session equals ADA. See examples below.

Most students are enrolled full time with their record showing 100 for the Percentage of Time Enrolled for Calendar. Students enrolled in a part-time pre-kindergarten or kindergarten program (half-day or alternate-day) and students enrolled in a semester-about rotation CTC/AVTS program are considered 100% enrolled.

For students enrolled less than full time, calculate percentage by dividing the student’s weekly instructional time by the total weekly instructional time. For example, a student takes one class per day, five days per week (45 minutes X 5 days = 225 minutes). If weekly instructional time is 1,725 minutes, then 225 ÷ 1,725 = .13, or 13 percent.

If the percentage for part-time membership varies through the school year for a student, calculate a weighted percent. For example, 20% membership for 20 weeks and 30% membership for 16 weeks:

[(20% X 20) + (30% X 16)] ÷ 36 weeks = .244, or 24.

A common error made by LEAs is using the Percentage of Time Enrolled as a percentage of attendance. Another error is prorating the equivalent aggregate days membership twice – by populating the prorated membership days in the Days Enrolled field and by using the Percentage of Time Enrolled field to prorate.

:::info[Examples]
The following show Days Enrolled and Percentage of Time Enrolled in Calendar when student is enrolled less than 100% of the time.

-   Student is enrolled the full school year, or 180 days, in an intermediate unit class and mainstreamed in a school district class:
-   Intermediate unit reports 180 days enrolled @ 75% (135 equivalent days ÷ 180 days in session = .750 ADM)
-   School district reports 180 days enrolled @ 25% (45 equivalent days ÷ 180 days in session = .250 ADM)
-   Nonpublic, home education or privately tutored student is enrolled for one semester, for two classes or part-time in a public school:
-   School district reports 90 days enrolled @ 26% (23 equivalent days ÷ 180 days in session = .127 ADM)
-   Student enrolled in a part-time, half-day program at the high school and CTC/AVTS (50% enrolled, regardless of the actual instructional time):
-   Charter school reports 180 days @ 50% (90 equivalent days ÷ 180 days in session = .500 ADM)
-   CTC/AVTS reports 178 days @ 50% (89 equivalent days ÷ 178 days in session = .500 ADM)
-   Student enrolled part-time (one class) at the high school and full-day at the CTC/AVTS:
-   School district reports 180 days @ 13% (23 equivalent days ÷ 180 days in session = .127 ADM)
-   CTC/AVTS reports 178 days @ 87% (155 equivalent days ÷ 178 days in session = .870 ADM)
-   Membership for part-time students who are on track to graduate is prorated based on the amount of instructional time they receive compared to a full-time student.
-   School district reports 179 days @ 39% (70 equivalent days ÷ 179 days in session = .391 ADM)

**Field 13 - [SENDING CHARTER SCHOOL – SCHOOL NUMBER](#13---sending-charter-school--school-number) & Field 14 - [SENDING CHARTER SCHOOL AUN](#14---sending-charter-school-aun)** 

When a charter school contracts with another public entity to educate their student, the educating entity populates these fields with the charter school’s School Number (4-digit building number) and the charter school’s administrative unit number (9-digit AUN). These fields are not key fields. If a student changes charter schools mid-year, the educating entity must create a second Student Calendar Fact record using a different Calendar ID (key field). The “Days Enrolled” will be attributed to each resident school district/charter school combination.
