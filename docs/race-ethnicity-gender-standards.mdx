# Race, Ethnicity, Gender

## Federal Race, Ethnicity, and Gender Standards

The USDE directs the way State Education Agencies (SEA) and LEAs are expected to maintain, collect, and report data on race, ethnicity, and gender.

Beginning in the fall of 2010, SEAs and LEAs are required to report aggregated data to USDE using the standards detailed in this section.

These standards mandate a two-question format categorizing the race and ethnicity of students and educators. Refer to the chart below for further instructions. In order to implement the required change with minimal burden, LEA requirements for collecting and maintaining race/ethnicity differ from those for reporting these data in PIMS.

Collecting Race or Ethnicity Data

A two-part question is mandatory, with ethnicity asked first and race asked second:

-   Part 1: Ethnicity (choose one):
    -   Hispanic/Latino
    -   Not Hispanic/Latino
-   Part 2: Race (choose one or more, regardless of ethnicity):
    -   American Indian or Alaskan Native
    -   Asian
    -   Black or African American
    -   Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
    -   White

Self-identification of race or ethnicity by the student or their parent or guardian is preferable, and individuals must always be encouraged to identify their own race and ethnicity, although respondents are *not required* to do so. The [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2008/rediguide/ch4_3.asp) describes measures that the LEA can take to ensure individual dignity and promote accurate reporting when individuals are reluctant to self-identify. Observer-identification is federally required as a last resort.

## Reporting Race/Ethnicity Data in PIMS

LEAs should use the following standards when reporting race/ethnicity data in PIMS:

| **If Ethnicity selected is: (Part 1)** | **and Race selected is: (Part 2)**        |  **then report this:**                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hispanic/Latino                        | Any race                                  | Students are reported as Hispanic/Latino if they identify themselves as such. This designation overrides any race selected in Part 2. |
| Not Hispanic/Latino                    | American Indian or Alaskan Native         | American Indian or Alaskan native only                                                                                                |
| Not Hispanic/Latino                    | Asian                                     | Asian only                                                                                                                            |
| Not Hispanic/Latino                    | Black or African American                 | Black or African American only                                                                                                        |
| Not Hispanic/Latino                    | Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander | Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander only                                                                                        |
| Not Hispanic/Latino                    | White                                     | White only                                                                                                                            |
| Not Hispanic/Latino                    | Two or more races                         | Multi-racial                                                                                                                          |

## Recordkeeping

As in the past, original records must be maintained for three years. However, when there is litigation, a claim, an audit, or another action involving the records, original responses must be retained until the completion of the action.

The above information is a summarization of standards detailed in: *MANAGING an IDENTITY CRISIS: Forum Guide to Implementing New Federal Race and Ethnicity Categories* is found in the 2008-802 publication on the [ED Pubs website](https://www.ed.gov/edpubs). This publication is available from the USDE online (edpubs.ed.gov) or call toll free (1-877-4ED-Pubs).

## Race/Ethnicity Definitions

These are categories used to describe groups to which individuals belong, identify with, or belong to in the eyes of the community. These categories do not denote scientific definitions of anthropological origins.

-   **AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE** – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.
-   **ASIAN** – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.
-   **BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN** – A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa (except those of Hispanic origin).
-   **HISPANIC** – A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
-   **NATIVE HAWAIIAN or OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER** – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
-   **WHITE** – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East (except those of Hispanic origin).
-   **TWO OR MORE RACES** – Multi-racial. A person having origins in more than one of the previous categories.

## Reporting Student Gender

A student, parent, or guardian may request a change of the student’s listed gender information, first name, or middle name on their records. If this request occurs, the LEA may report the student’s preferred information using the following guidelines:

1.  The change must first be made in PAsecureID;
2.  The PIMS data (first name (field 134), gender (field 15), and date of birth (field 14)) must match what is reported in PAsecureID;
3.  Gender identity (field 225) in PIMS must be updated to reflect the student’s personal conception if they are “Nonbinary or Not Listed”;
4.  The student’s name and gender information reported in prior school years will not be updated; and
5.  The student’s PAsecureID will not be changed.

:::note
Gender (field 15) will continue to be only male/female for federal reporting purposes.
